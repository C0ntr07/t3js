# Initial Setup

Alright let's put this scooter in drive! We're going to pack a few things before heading out:

- Your favorite text editor
- A terminal application is handy
- Git and Yeoman are installed

The code we will be walking through is available [here](google.com) on GitHub.

## The Application

We will be creating our very own T3 Meme Generator in this exercise. Let's go over what we mean by this before getting our hands dirty. First, a quick snapshot of the finished product:

The functionality we will be implementing in this application is simple, the user will be able to click on a meme they would like to use as background text and using the two input fields that are available they will be able to update the text that is overlayed on the image.

Each step of the way has a corresponding branch that you can fast-forward and rewind to. It's the name of tutorial page you are on in the URL, simply do a `git checkout initial-setup` to get started. Now that everything is in order, let's get down to business.
