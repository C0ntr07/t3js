# Tutorials
Greetings, welcome to T3! In this tutorial example we will use the T3 framework to build a meme generator. (What's a meme generator? Look [here](http://imgur.com/memegen) before proceeding.) We are assuming that you are comfortable with technologies on the web (HTML/CSS/JS). If you ever have a question related to T3 functionality you can always pull up another tab with the handy documentation we have available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs).

Let's get started!
