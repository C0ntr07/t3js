# Tutorial Overview

Welcome! In this tutorial you will get an overview of the T3 JavaScript framework. You should be comfortable with technologies on the web (HTML/CSS/JS). If you ever have a question related to T3 functionality you can always pull up another tab with the handy documentation we have available [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs).

## The Application

First, we will talk about what you will be building. You will be creating your very own Meme Generator in this exercise. Here's a screenshot of what the finished application will look like:

![Fully built meme generator]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/tutorial-finished.png)

The application provides the user the ability to change the text overlayed on the image and to choose the background image (the meme) that will be used from a list of available thumbnails.

There are two features that you will implement:

- Input controls to manipulate the overlayed text on the image
- A list of thumbnails that can click and update the background meme image

The typical user flow for the application will be to choose a meme and type in some text for the header and footer. With this application in mind, we will review the components you will build.
